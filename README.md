# reactrandomkidpicker
A react web app to settle the age-old question... who's turn is it to take out the trash?

Right now, my kids' names are hard-coded into state. Hoping to develop a version that accepts user input on kids.

Demo available at https://randomkidpicker.netlify.com/, which automatically redeploys this repo as pull requests are merged to master.
